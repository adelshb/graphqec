        The CNOT order must ensure stabilisers mutually
        commute so give deterministic measurement outcomes
        in the absence of errors. Practically,
        shared data qubits between two or more stabilisers
        must be interacted with in the same relative order
        by their shared stabilisers. That is, if one stabiliserâ€™s
        interaction precedes another for any shared
        qubit, it must do so for all shared qubits.

        Unnecessary idling errors can be avoided by ensuring
        that all CNOTs in a particular time step are
        physically parallel (aligned along the same axis).
        For instance, this implies that while
        all the X-type stabilisers are interacting with data
        qubits 0 or 2 (1 or 3), the Z-type stabilisers must
        also interact with either 0 or 2 (1 or 3), but not
